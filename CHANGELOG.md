# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Language and libraries
- First-class function values and closures (`fn(Int) -> Int` types, lambdas that
  capture, named functions as values, closures returned from functions), in the
  interpreter, the checker (lambda parameter types inferred from context) and the
  native backend.
- `String` methods (`length trim split lines replace contains starts_with ends_with
  to_upper to_lower to_int to_float`), `List<String>.join`, `parse_csv`, `\r` escape.
- Operator overloading completed: unary `-x` (`neg`) and scalar-on-the-left operators
  (`2.0 * x` via `rmul`/`radd`/`rsub`/`rdiv`), plus mixed right-hand types.
- Fixed-width integers, `Float32`, `Array<T>` with broadcasting, masks and slices,
  `@` matrix product (now also matrix-vector), statistics, regression, `Rng`,
  deterministic elementary functions, `det inv trace eye norm eigvals`.
- `--test` runner (`test_*` functions with `assert` / `assert_eq`).
- Example packages written in Ostrin itself: `tables` (CSV DataFrame with filter and
  group-by), `plot` (SVG scatter/line) and `autodiff` (forward-mode dual numbers).

### Compiler
- Native backend: closures, moved-after-send (E1101), strings, arrays, math, `Rng`,
  module-qualified names; interpreter and native output are compared on every example.
- Typed HIR with a verifier (`--hir`), per-node checker/backend type agreement,
  `--typed-report` and `--native-type-report`.
- Native HIR migration expanded through the fourth family: `Option`/`Result`
  constructors, `match`, basic queries, unwrap/coercion helpers and `try`
  propagation are emitted directly from `hir_c.rs`; lambda combinators and
  `catch` deliberately remain on the AST fallback until closures are migrated.
- Native HIR migration now covers the fifth family’s collection core: `List`,
  `Map` and `Set` literals, local collection types, list indexing/iteration,
  basic list/map/set methods and `List<String>.join`; collection combinators
  that receive closures still use the AST fallback.
- Native HIR migration now covers closures and function values: captured
  lambdas, named-function thunks, indirect calls, and `List` combinators
  (`map`, `filter`, `fold`, `any`, `all`, `find`) that invoke closures from HIR.
- Native HIR migration now specializes concrete generic function instances
  from the checker's `CallSubst`: scalar generic functions, `List<T>` indexing,
  `Option<T>` construction and structural methods can emit directly from the
  specialized HIR, while nested/unsupported generic shapes safely retain the
  AST fallback. The differential HIR ratchet is now 90 (98 measured).
- Generic functions emitted from HIR can now call other concrete generic
  instances, including recursive/self calls: the backend queues any newly
  discovered monomorphization, registers its direct C name and prototype, and
  rewrites the specialized HIR call without applying the ordinary source-name
  prefix. Coverage is now 98 measured functions/methods.
- Generic `record<T>` and `enum<T>` instances are now visible to HIR with their
  concrete C names, fields, variants and tags. Specialized generic bodies can
  emit record literals/field access, enum constructors and `match` patterns;
  nested applied type arguments preserve their source-level HIR spelling. The
  differential HIR ratchet is now 110 (117 measured).
- Generic method instances now use their collision-free impl declaration in
  HIR, including generic methods on applied records and nested calls such as
  `container.map<U>(value)`. The existing monomorphization queue remains the
  single source of concrete C bodies; the differential HIR ratchet is now 115
  (119 measured).
- Module loader now rewrites types in signatures, fields, variants and annotations
  (a `record` from another module can be used as a type).
- CI on Linux, macOS and Windows.

### Project
- Added the official Ostrin geometric logo and initial brand guide.
- Added the first VS Code extension with `.ostrin` recognition, syntax
  highlighting and compiler commands.
- Added the public-project README, contribution guidelines, code of conduct,
  license and website foundation.
- Continued strengthening generic trait defaults, applied implementations and
  static concrete method checking.
